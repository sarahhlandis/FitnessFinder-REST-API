## Purpose:
The FitnessFinder API is an application that intends to mitigate and ease the process of finding a fitness center. Often, when searching for a new gym or studio, one must travel to the prospective facilities to check what amenities they have, hours, and just to gain general info. This application aims to make this process easier for people by having this info all in one place, thus making it easier to compare facilities and find one that better suits their needs.

## Resolution:
This problems needs to be solved because with the evergrowing population of fitness centers, gyms, pilates studios, etc. it can be overwhelming finding something that suits all your needs. This application congregates all the relevant data into one place making it much easier to do preliminary research when starting this process. Upgrades of this app may include a user portal in which users can review and rate facilities making it even easier to see which gyms may be suitable for the prospective gym-goer's needs.
